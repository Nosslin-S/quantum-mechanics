    "\n",
    "Random walk is mathematical concept describing a path composed of succession of random steps in certain space. A specific case of random walk is Brownian motion, which is a type of diffusion model. Although each step is random, we can study the path in a statistically standpoint thus creating a possibility to connect microscopic behavior with macroscopic observation.\n",

    "According to Fick's laws of diffusion, the mean squared displacement from Brownian motion is given by:\n",
    "$$\\text{MSD} = \\langle(x-x_0)^2 \\rangle = 2nDt \\quad (1)$$\n",
    "where $x_0$ is the reference position, n is the dimension of Brownian motion and D is the diffusion coefficient. The square root of MSD indicates how far the particle has drift away after time t, which is why we define $r_{\\text{std}}=\\sqrt{\\text{MSD}}$"
